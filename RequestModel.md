With your own Oracle contract, you can use your own node to fulfill requests.

Chainlink nodes can fulfill requests from open or unauthenticated APIs without the need for External Adapters as long as you've added the jobs to the node. 

For these requests, requesters supply the URL to the open API that they want each node to retrieve. The Chainlink node will use tasks to fulfill the request.
